# ![burger](/Firmware/Assets/Desktop/burger.png) Cyberdeck-OS

just messing around with ideas
havin a laff

basic PDA kinda operating system thing for an ESP32 smashed together with a keyboard and an e-ink display, using FreeRTOS as a base.

Build using VSCode and Platform IO

## To-do list
- [ ] Figure out how to structure programs
- [ ] Get graphics working at all
- [ ] Implement a basic desktop & windowing system
- [ ] How about a CLI interface?
- [ ] Write some test programs
- [ ] Should the desktop itself be a program? I guess so.
- [ ] come up with a project name

## concept

- ![Mockup1](/assets/mockup-desktop.png)
- *Desktop. Recent files and quick launch stuff goes here? Maybe make the start button just bring the desktop up?*
